"rules": [
"To play Ultimate Frisbee, the field is 80 yards long and 2 end zones each 20 yards long; similar to a football field.", 
"Officially, 2 teams play each other with 7 players on the field for each team.", 
"To start, one team in an end zone throws the frisbee to the other team at the other end zone.", 
"The goal is to get the frisbee caught in your end zone.", 
"The only way to move the frisbee forward is to throw it to your teammates. Once someone catches the frisbee, they have to stop running as soon as they can; ideally in one or two steps. The thrower can have a pivot foot.", 
"After a point is scored, the scoring team switches direction and throws the disc to the other team at the other end zone.", 
"If the thrower moves their pivot foot or runs with the frisbee, then other team takes possession of the frisbee.", 
"When on defense, team tries to block throws, knock down the frisbee in flight, or catch a thrown frisbee. Wherever the frisbee falls, that is where the other team starts. The player defending the person with the frisbee counts to 7 out loud. If the thrower does not throw the frisbee by 7, then the other team gets the frisbee.", 
"Fouls are hitting the frisbee in a player's hand before the disc is released or any aggressive or unsafe contact. Sportsmanship is a great value in Ultimate Frisbee, so calling your own fouls is encouraged.", 
"The game can be played for a certain amount of time with highest score wins, or it can end at reaching a set amount of points."
